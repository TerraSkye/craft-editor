# Template Editor for Craft CMS (Alpha)

Editor is a web based template editor for craft CMS.

Please use this at your own risk, is it works at file system level, I cannot
guarentee that you will not lose template files. Please backup your templates
before use.

I reserve the right to release this a paid plugin when the features and quality
improve.
